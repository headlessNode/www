* -   `process.nextTick` is only Node.js.

* -   Everything else is browser based (e.g., mutation observer, requestAnimationFrame, etc).
* -   Only API which is universal is `setTimeout`.
* -   Note that `0` is not actually `0ms`. Browser environments commonly have a minimum delay of `4ms`. This is acceptable. Here, the main intent of this function is to give the runtime a chance to run garbage collection, clear state, and tend to any other pending tasks before returning control to benchmark tasks. The larger aim (attainable or not) is to provide each benchmark run with as much of a fresh state as possible.

/**
* Returns an array of an object's own enumerable and non-enumerable property names.
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   In contrast to the built-in `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()`, this function returns an empty array if provided `undefined` or `null`, rather than throwing an error.
* -   In environments lacking support for `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()`, property descriptors are unavailable, and thus all properties can be safely assumed to be enumerable. Hence, we can defer to calling `Object.keys`, which retrieves all own enumerable property names.
*
* @private
* @param {*} value - input object
* @returns {Array} a list of own property names
*
* @example
* var obj = {
*     'beep': 'boop',
*     'foo': 3.14
* };

* var keys = getOwnPropertyNames( obj );

// a transform stream is a readable/writable stream where you do
// something with the data.  Sometimes it's called a "filter",
// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where
// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would
// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)
//
// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a
// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,
// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then
// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.
//
// Here's how this works:
//
// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable
// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)
// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes
// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until
// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.
//
// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When
// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the
// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single
// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first
// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into
// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.
//
// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,
// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,
// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering
// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is
// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many
// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in
// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small
// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In
// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell
// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could
// cause the system to run out of memory.
//
// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk
// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until
// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.
